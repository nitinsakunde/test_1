	    @ final : it is basically a keyword and we use with the class , method , variable
	     
	   -  if we use with the # CLASS then we can not inherite that class for ex. string class
	   -  if we use with the # VARIABLES then we can not modify that veriable
	   -  if we use with the # METHOD then we can not override that method
	     
	   @  finally : it is a block which is used for cleanup purpose
	   - it is used with the try and catch block
	   -it is used to closed the operation
	   
	    for ex:
	    
	    try{
	    
	    //riskey code
	     
	    }catch(exception e){
	    
	    // code
	      
	    }finally{
	    
	    //close code 
	     for ex :  driver.close() , wb.close(), db.close()
	     
	    }
	  @ finalise  : it is method which is present in object class (superclass of all class)
